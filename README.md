# Flashcard-Generator | Assignment: Cloze Constructors

## Overview 
Create the backend for a basic flashcard application.

The backend will essentially constitute an API that allows users to create two types of flashcards.

1. **Basic** flashcards, which have a front (_"Who was the first president of the United States?"_), and a back (_"George Washington"_).

2. **Cloze-Deleted** flashcards, which present _partial_ text (_"... was the first president of the United States."_), and the full text when the user requests it (_"George Washington was the first president of the United States."_)

#### Cloze Deletions

A **cloze deletion** is simply a sentence that has had some of its text removed. For example, given the sentence:

_"George Washington was the first president of the United States."_

...We can create a "cloze deletion" by removing the words _"George Washington"_:

_"... was the first president of the United States."_

This is useful for building flash card applications that forces users to remember the important part of a sentence, and is [a common device in educational applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloze_test).

A flash card built this way has three parts:

1. The **full text**. This is the entire sentence users need to remember:  _"George Washington was the first president of the United States."_

2. The **cloze deletion**. This is the text we've chosen to remove: _"George Washington"_.

3. The **partial text**. This is what we get if we remove the **cloze deletion** from the **full text**: _"... was the first president of the United States._

See below for examples as to how your constructor should behave.


## Instructions

 **Basic**
  * The file architecture should define a Node module that exports a constructor for creating basic flashcards, e.g.:
    `module.exports = BasicCard;`

  * Build scope-safe constructors that accept two arguments: `front` and `back`.

  * The constructed object should have a `front` property that contains the text on the front of the card.

  * The constructed object should have a `back` property that contains the text on the back of the card.


**cloze deletion**
  * This file should define a Node module that exports a constructor for creating cloze-deletion flashcards, e.g.:
    `module.exports = ClozeCard;`

  * Build scope-safe constructors that accept two arguments: `text` and `cloze`. 

  * The constructed object should have a `cloze` property that contains _only_ the cloze-deleted portion of the text.

  * The constructed object should have a `partial` property that contains _only_ the partial text.

  * The constructed object should have a `fullText` property that contains _only_ the full text.

  * The constructor should throw or log an error when the cloze deletion does _not_ appear in the input text.

  * Use prototypes to attach these methods, wherever possible.
